TheQuestGame
This lab project is from the book "Head First C#" A Brain-Friendly guide, by Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene. Directions are given to 
programmer/learner which has to complete most of the code by himself. It's a great exersise wich helps you learn the four OOP principles even 
better. Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphysm.
I have used some resources the book provided, like gif images.
THe project was done with Microsoft(R) Visual Studio Community 2015.
